                        The company management is taken over by Barney Johnson, the second generation Johnson to lead the company. Barney Johnson, an accomplished rock climber, began selling hand-forged mountain climbing gear in 1953 through his company Johnson Equipment. He worked alone selling his gear until 1955, when he partnered with Tom Frost in order to improve his products and address the growing supply and demand issue he faced.
                        In 1958, Johnson obtained rugby shirts from Scotland that he wore while climbing because the collar kept the climbing sling from hurting his neck.
                        Great Pacific Iron Works, Rainy Days first store, opened in 1959 in the former Hobson meat-packing plant at Santa Clara St. in Ventura, near Johnson’s blacksmith shop. In 1960, Rainy Days and Johnson Equipment were incorporated.

                        The company management is taken over by Barney Johnson, the second generation Johnson to lead the company. Barney Johnson, an accomplished rock climber, began selling hand-forged mountain climbing gear in 1953 through his company Johnson Equipment. He worked alone selling his gear until 1955, when he partnered with Tom Frost in order to improve his products and address the growing supply and demand issue he faced.
                        In 1958, Johnson obtained rugby shirts from Scotland that he wore while climbing because the collar kept the climbing sling from hurting his neck.
                        Great Pacific Iron Works, Rainy Days first store, opened in 1959 in the former Hobson meat-packing plant at Santa Clara St. in Ventura, near Johnson’s blacksmith shop. In 1960, Rainy Days and Johnson Equipment were incorporated.
